Here you can find my scientific publications, mainly in my research field of Computational Group Theory.

## PhD Thesis

- Rober, F. (2025). [Wreath product decompositions]((https://www.art.rwth-aachen.de/cms/mathb/forschung/publikationen/~rekk/details/?file=1018873&lidx=1)) (PhD thesis, RWTH Aachen University).

## Journal Articles

- Bernhardt, D., Niemeyer, A. C., Rober, F., & Wollenhaupt, L. (2022). [Conjugacy classes and centralisers in wreath products](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747717122000177). Journal of Symbolic Computation, 113, 97–125.

## GAP Software-Packages

[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) is an open source computational algebra system and programming language. I developed the following packages in the GAP ecosystem:

- [LINS (**L**ow **I**ndex **N**ormal **S**ubgroups)](https://github.com/gap-packages/LINS) provides an algorithm for computing the normal subgroups of a finitely presented group up to some given index bound.
- [WPE (**W**reath **P**roduct **E**lements)](https://github.com/gap-packages/WPE) provides efficient methods for working with wreath products.

## GAP Contributions

I also contributed to the following GAP repositories:

- [GAP](https://github.com/gap-system/gap): My main contribution is a better low-level interface for wreath product elements.
- [GAP Package Distro](https://github.com/gap-system/PackageDistro) and [GAP Release Tools](https://github.com/gap-system/ReleaseTools): I was involved in scripts used for the CI, automatic reports on pull requests and release management via Github actions.
- [GAP-Package Recog](https://github.com/FriedrichRober/recog): My main contribution is the implementation of an Sn-An recognition algorithm in joint work with [Sergio Siccha](https://github.com/ssiccha), mainly based on Jambor, S., Leuner, M., Niemeyer, A. C., & Plesken, W. (2013). [Fast recognition of alternating groups of unknown degree]((https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869313003190?via%3Dihub)). Journal of Algebra, 392, 315–335.
