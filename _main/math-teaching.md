I was a graduate assistant at RWTH Aachen University during my PhD.
I managed multiple **higher mathematics courses** (for civil engineers) with about 2000 students,
and was team lead for 5-10 people. My team and I developed the online exercises and exams in the new teaching software [Dynexite](https://help.itc.rwth-aachen.de/en/service/8d9eb2f36eea4fcaa9abd0e1ca008b22/article/41d91a35d6414293b4346dc656ac3e80/), using **python** to create **dynamically generated parametrized tasks** and detailed **step-by-step solutions**.

## Details

We developed multiple **solvers** for linear systems and differential systems that generate alongside the result also a human-readable solution path for the students. We use **randomly** assigned values for multiple parameters in our tasks, and ensure with multiple **heuristics** that the numbers in (intermediate) results of the solution path are nice to compute with for a human. The students can generate as many instances of the task as they like for practicing. Part of the exams incorporated some of these standard computational tasks. Apart from this, we also created a library of static and dynamic tasks that cover all topics of the courses Higher Mathematics I-III, which include **linear algebra**, (multi-dimensional) **analysis** and **differential systems**.
